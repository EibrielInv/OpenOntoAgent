# OpenOntoAgent
Experimental and incomplete OntoAgent architecture. Released as Open Source code.


Inspired by the book [Linguistics for the Age of AI](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/linguistics-age-ai) by Marjorie McShane and Sergei Nirenburg, and aditional literature.


Using OWL was promising, but looks like each Lexical Sense should be a OWL Class, that don't seems entirely right.

Lexical Senses imposes constraints (syntactic structure), and modify the values of other elements (semantic structure, meaning procedures).
